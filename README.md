# Auklet for Java
[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/e1ced62442c7cf49d58a/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/aukletio/Auklet-Agent-Java/maintainability)

This is the Java agent for Auklet, officially supporting Java 7+.

# Features

* Automatic report of unhandled exceptions.
* Location, and system metrics identification for all issues.


# Quickstart

* Download the agent JAR using Maven or Gradle from https://bintray.com/aukletio/agent-java/auklet-agent-java.
* Configure your app ID and API key using the environment variables `AUKLET_APP_ID` and `AUKLET_API_KEY` or the
JVM system properties `auklet.app.id` and `auklet.api.key`.
* The agent needs a dedicated folder to create and store its configuration files. The agent will create these files 
on startup if they do not exist, or will use files that are already available on disk.

# Authorization

To authorize your application you need to provide both an API key and app ID.
These values are available in the connection settings of your application as well as during initial setup.
